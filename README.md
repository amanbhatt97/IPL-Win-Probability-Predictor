# IPL Win Predictor

The IPL Win Predictor is a machine learning-based web application that estimates the probability of an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket team winning a match. It takes into account various match conditions and factors to provide a prediction of winning probabilities for each team.

## Description

The **IPL Win Predictor** is implemented as a Streamlit web application. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions based on input parameters such as the teams playing, host city, current match conditions (score, overs, wickets), and the target score.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit: Interactive web application framework
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model loading
- Pandas: Data manipulation library
- Pickle: For loading the pre-trained model
- Git: Version control and collaboration

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/amanbhatt97/IPL-Win-Probability-Predictor.git
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`: pip install -r requirements.txt

 ## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
2. Use the dropdowns and input fields to select teams, city, target score, and current match conditions.
3. Click the "Predict Probability" button to view the winning probabilities for the batting and bowling teams.
